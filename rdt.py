Selective Repeat reliable data transfer over UDP.

Key points:
- Reliability: CRC32, per-packet timers, selective retransmissions
- Reordering support with in-order delivery to the app
- Very low send rate without congestion control:
  We enforce < 500 bps by using small payloads (32B) and a fixed 0.6s gap between packets.

Module overview
---------------
This module implements the sender/receiver state machines for a minimal Selective Repeat (SR) protocol over UDP.
It relies on `protocol.Packet` for serialization and integrity (CRC32). The `RDTSession` class encapsulates all per-peer state:

  - Sender side:
      - Sliding window (size = DEFAULT_WINDOW)
      - Per-packet timers and selective retransmissions
      - Throttled send rate (SEND_GAP) to satisfy the sub-500 bps requirement

  - Receiver side:
      - Validates CRC32
      - Sends per-packet ACKs
      - Buffers out-of-order data; delivers in order to the application via a queue
